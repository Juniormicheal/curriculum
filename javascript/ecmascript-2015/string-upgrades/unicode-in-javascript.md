# Unicode in JavaScript


---

## Content

JavaScript strings are represented using UTF-16 code units. A code unit is a 16-bit value that represents a character from the UTF-16 encoding. On top of that, each Unicode character has an ID (an integer which starts at 0) which is that character's codepoint.

Each code unit can be used to represent a code point in the `[U+0000, U+FFFF]` range. Code points beyond that range are represented by a surrogate pair.  

Since ES6 the notation has been simplified:

```js
\\ represents U+1F332 (EVERGREEN TREE)
"\u{1F332}"=="🌲"=="\uD83C\uDF32"
```

Having multiple code units per code point means that `.length` is not reliable:

```js
"🌲🌲🌲".length; // length is 6
```

However, the string iterator can be used to loop over code **points** rather than code **units**:

```js
for (let codePoint of "🌲✈❤") {
  console.log(codePoint);
}
// '🌲'
// '✈'
// '❤'
```

Use `.codePointAt` to get the base-10 numeric representation of a code point at a given position in a string (indexed by code unit).

```js
for (let codePoint of "🌲✈❤") {
  console.log(codePoint.codePointAt(0));
}
/*
127794 (EVERGREEN TREE)
9992 (AIRPLANE)
10084 (HEAVY BLACK HEART)
*/
```

## Practice

What method is used to get the base-10 numeric representation of a code point at a given position in a string?

```js
for (let codePoint of '🌲🌲') {
  console.log(codePoint.???(0));
}
```

- `codePointAt`
- `codePoint`
- `codePointRep`
- `base10point`

## Revision

How are Javascript strings represented?

???

- `UTF-16`
- `UTF-8`
- `UTF-32`
- `US-ASCII`
